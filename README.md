<br>
Set remote: `git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git`
<br>
Rename your project in `build/index.html`, `build/webpack.base.config.js` and `package.json`

<br>

## Tips
- Mark `src` directory as source in your IDE
- Place all static files (images, fonts etc) in assets directory
- Make components as small as you can and collect them in page
- See how works router, component including and props passing, start from `router/index.js` file
